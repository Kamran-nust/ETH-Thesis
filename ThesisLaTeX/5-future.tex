\chapter{Problems and Future Work}\label{prbftr}
In this chapter, some problems in the prediction results, along with the corresponding possible solutions, are presented in section \ref{prblms}. Section \ref{ftrwrk} illustrates the future direction of our work.

\section{Problems}\label{prblms}
This section mainly shows the two existed problems in the prediction result, and proposes potential solutions respectively. Subsection \ref{outres} shows the resolution problem resulting in the inaccurate prediction and subsection \ref{flsvtx} shows the problem of false vertex.

\subsection{Output Resolution}\label{outres}
We know that the output grid for a single vertex has the resolution 28$\times$28. The input resolution of PolygonRNN is 224$\times$224. Thus, a single pixel in the output grid corresponds to an area of 8$\times$8 in the original image. This will result in inaccurate output vertices.

(Example)

The possible solution is to increase the resolution of the output grid, and to extract features from relatively shallow levels. However, these shallow layers may not have much semantic information, which may further have negative effect on the prediction accuracy of RNN part. In addition, because of the existence of FC layer in the end of the output of RNN part, the number of its weights would increase at the fourth power, i.e. $\Theta(w^2h^2)$. For example, currently, the FC layer has $(28^2)^2 = $ 614,656 weights, if we increase the resolution of the output grid to 56$\times$56, the number of weights would be $(56^2)^2 = $ 9,834,496, 16 times the original. The explosively increasing parameters can make the entire network more difficult to train, and meanwhile, it would also greatly increase the time and space (storage) consumption. Therefore, the conclusion is that if the resolution is increased, we would better adapt the network structure to meet the requirement of the increasing resolution.

\subsection{False Vertex}\label{flsvtx}
Actually, after the introduction of beam search algorithm, the false vertex problem has been solved a lot and the prediction is greatly improved (see table \ref{tab:evalmodin}), but there are still some in the results.

(Example)

The possible solution comes from the point of view of geometry, penalizing the angle degree of the polygon. Figure \ref{fig:agldstb} shows the polygon interior angle degree distribution in the dataset of Zurich and Chicago.

\input{fig/5-02}

From figure \ref{fig:agldstbchicago} we can see that in Chicago, most angles are at $90^\circ$ or $270^\circ$, indicating that most of them are right angles, which is easier for machine to learn. This is also the reason why the dataset of Chicago gets a higher performance. In Zurich's figure \ref{fig:agldstbzurich}, although most angles are around $90^\circ$ or $270^\circ$, they have certain deviations about $\pm20^\circ$. Also, there is a peak near $180^\circ$ in figure \ref{fig:agldstbzurich}, which means that there are many three-point collinearity in the dataset of Zurich.

In practice of penalizing the angle degree of the polygon, when doing the probability computation of the next vertex, we can use the distribution of the angle $\theta$ as a priori to guide the prediction, i.e. replace $P(v_t \mid v_{t-1}, v_{t-2})$ in equation \ref{eq:vnext} with $P(v_t \mid v_{t-1}, v_{t-2}, \theta)$. This requires the function $F$ to take $\theta$ as input, which also requires a change of the network structure in order to feed this prior in.

\section{Future Work}\label{ftrwrk}
In this section, several future directions of our work are presented, such as possible direction of roads segmentation, the improvement of the dataset, the methods that are helpful for training and the possible extensions of the model.

\paragraph{Segmentation of Roads}
At present, our thesis project does not include road segmentation. This is because roads usually cannot be represented as polygons. However, we still hope to add this kind of segmentation in the future, so that the geometrical instance segmentation in aerial images can become complete, and we can also further learn the geometrical layout of the city from aerial images. The basic idea for roads  segmentation is to convert roads into centerlines and intersections. Actually, in Mask R-CNN \cite{maskrcnn}, the part of human posture detection is exactly doing this, where a person is structurized as several keypoints with edges connecting them. Figure \ref{fig:posdet} shows some human posture detection results of Mask R-CNN.

\input{fig/5-03}

However, it is difficult to apply this method to our project, because the road is different from the human body, the number of keypoints of roads in each image is not fixed. That is the biggest obstacle to structurize roads.

\paragraph{Ground Truth Correction}
Subsection \ref{adjust} has already introduced a method to correct ground truth. However, there are still some image-polygon pairs inaccurate, especially for those adjacent buildings (see figure \ref{fig:egshi3}). We hope that the dataset can be collected from single source, so that the polygons and the buildings are more likely to match each other. As for the adjacent buildings, it is difficult for us to merge their polygons into a single one. Thus, we hope polygons of buildings instead of houses can be provided.

\paragraph{RoIAlign Implementation}
Subsection \ref{algmod} has already introduced the hybrid version with RoIAlign of \modelnameshort. We hope that in the future this kind of version can be implemented and tested. In theory, it can speed up both the training and prediction phases.

\paragraph{Training Method}
Our model does not use pre-trained VGG-16 during training, neither as an initializer nor as fixed weights. In the future we may apply the pre-trained VGG-16 to our model's training. Besides, we hope that the alternating training method can be introduced, of which the main idea is to train the subnetworks separately, then train them together and fine-tune the whole model. For more details about this kind of training, please refer to the Fast R-CNN paper \cite{fasterrcnn}.

\paragraph{Model Generalization}
In fact, our model can be applied not only to the geometrical instance segmentation in the aerial images, but also to other kinds of images which contain multiple objects. We hope that our model \modelnameshort can be generalized to other fields and we can compare the performance under different dataset.
