    \caption[Visualization of RNN decoder in PolygonRNN with the time step]{Visualization of RNN decoder in PolygonRNN with the time step. In this figure, the outputs of the end signal are omitted, and the configuration of the ConvLSTM cell is the same as what is used in the original PolygonRNN paper \cite{polygonrnn}. Specifically, the paper sets the number of RNN layers to 2 and uses ConvLSTM cells with 3$\times$3 kernel size and 16 channels.}
